# Expanded Centenarian Cash Gift (ECA) System Implementation

## Overview

The ECA system has been successfully implemented to manage cash gifts for senior citizens at milestone ages (80, 85, 90, 95, and 100 years old). This document provides a comprehensive guide to the implementation.

## Database Schema

### Main Table: `expanded_centenarian_cash_gifts`

```sql
CREATE TABLE expanded_centenarian_cash_gifts (
  eca_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  citizen_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES citizens(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  eca_year INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (eca_year >= 2024),
  birth_date DATE NOT NULL,
  eca_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (eca_type IN (
    'octogenarian_80',
    'octogenarian_85', 
    'nonagenarian_90',
    'nonagenarian_95',
    'centenarian_100'
  )),
  eca_status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Applied' CHECK (eca_status IN (
    'Applied',
    'Validated', 
    'Paid',
    'Unpaid',
    'Disqualified'
  )),
  payment_date DATE,
  cash_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_by TEXT,
  updated_by TEXT,
  remarks TEXT,
  
  -- Ensure one application per citizen per type (lifetime benefit)
  UNIQUE(citizen_id, eca_type)
);
```

### Key Features

1. **Age-based Cash Amounts**:
   - Ages 80, 85, 90, 95: ₱10,000
   - Age 100: ₱100,000

2. **ECA Year Calculation**: Birth Year + Qualifying Age
   - Example: Born 1944 + 80 = 2024 ECA Year

3. **One-time Benefit**: Each citizen can only receive each ECA type once in their lifetime

4. **Status Workflow**: Applied → Validated → Paid/Unpaid/Disqualified

## Database Functions

### 1. `get_eca_eligible_citizens(target_year INTEGER)`
Returns eligible citizens for a specific year based on their age.

### 2. `generate_eca_applications(target_year INTEGER, created_by_user TEXT)`
Bulk generates ECA applications for all eligible citizens in a given year.

### 3. `get_citizen_eca_history(citizen_id_param INTEGER)`
Returns the complete ECA history for a specific citizen.

## Database Views

### 1. `eca_with_addresses`
Combines ECA records with complete citizen and address information.

### 2. `eca_statistics`
Provides aggregated statistics by year, type, and status.

## Frontend Components

### 1. ECA Management (`/eca/management`)
- **Features**:
  - View and filter ECA applications by year, type, and status
  - Search by citizen name, OSCA ID, or RRN
  - Update application status
  - Generate bulk applications for a specific year
  - Complete citizen and address information display

- **Key Functions**:
  - `fetchECARecords()`: Loads ECA records with filters
  - `generateECAApplications()`: Creates applications for eligible citizens
  - `updateECAStatus()`: Updates individual application status

### 2. ECA Dashboard (`/eca/dashboard`)
- **Features**:
  - Year-over-year statistics overview
  - ECA type breakdown with progress indicators
  - Detailed statistics table
  - Payment completion percentages
  - Total amounts and application counts

- **Key Metrics**:
  - Total applications per year
  - Payment completion rates
  - Amount distributions by type
  - Status breakdowns

## Business Logic

### Eligibility Rules
1. Citizens must be exactly 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100 years old in the target year
2. Citizens must have valid status (not Disqualified)
3. Citizens cannot receive the same ECA type twice
4. Citizens must reapply when they reach each milestone age

### Example Citizen Journey
**Maria Santos** (born January 15, 1944):
- **2024**: Age 80 → Eligible for octogenarian_80 (₱10,000)
- **2029**: Age 85 → Eligible for octogenarian_85 (₱10,000)
- **2034**: Age 90 → Eligible for nonagenarian_90 (₱10,000)
- **2039**: Age 95 → Eligible for nonagenarian_95 (₱10,000)
- **2044**: Age 100 → Eligible for centenarian_100 (₱100,000)

## Navigation Integration

The ECA system is integrated into the main navigation with two menu items:
- **ECA Dashboard**: Overview and statistics
- **ECA Management**: Application processing and management

## TypeScript Integration

The system includes complete TypeScript type definitions in `database.types.ts`:

```typescript
expanded_centenarian_cash_gifts: {
  Row: {
    eca_id: number
    citizen_id: number
    eca_year: number
    birth_date: string
    eca_type: 'octogenarian_80' | 'octogenarian_85' | 'nonagenarian_90' | 'nonagenarian_95' | 'centenarian_100'
    eca_status: 'Applied' | 'Validated' | 'Paid' | 'Unpaid' | 'Disqualified'
    payment_date: string | null
    cash_amount: number
    created_at: string
    updated_at: string
    created_by: string | null
    updated_by: string | null
    remarks: string | null
  }
  // Insert and Update types...
}
```

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Initial Setup
1. Run the migration: `supabase/migrations/20250526000000_expanded_centenarian_cash_gifts.sql`
2. The system will create all necessary tables, functions, views, and indexes

### 2. Generating Applications
1. Navigate to ECA Management
2. Select the target year (2024, 2025, etc.)
3. Click "Generate [Year] Applications"
4. The system will automatically create applications for all eligible citizens

### 3. Processing Applications
1. Use filters to find specific applications
2. Update status using the dropdown in the Actions column
3. Payment date is automatically set when status changes to "Paid"

### 4. Monitoring Progress
1. Use the ECA Dashboard to view overall statistics
2. Monitor payment completion rates
3. Track yearly trends and distributions

## Security Features

1. **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled on all tables
2. **Foreign key constraints** ensure data integrity
3. **Check constraints** validate data values
4. **Unique constraints** prevent duplicate benefits
5. **Audit trail** with created_by and updated_by tracking

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Indexes** on frequently queried columns:
   - citizen_id, eca_year, eca_status, eca_type, payment_date
2. **Views** for complex joins to improve query performance
3. **Denormalized birth_date** in ECA table for faster age calculations

## Future Enhancements

1. **Notification System**: Automatic alerts for eligible citizens
2. **Bulk Payment Processing**: Import payment confirmations
3. **Report Generation**: PDF reports for payments and statistics
4. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Enhanced mobile interface
5. **API Integration**: External payment system integration
